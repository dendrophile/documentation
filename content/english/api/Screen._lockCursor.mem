Should the cursor be locked?
The cursor will automatically be hidden, centered on view and made to never leave the view.

In the web player, the cursor may only be locked after the user has clicked on the content and the user has not left the content view with the cursor.
After the user presses escape or switches to another application the cursor will be automatically unlocked.
The cursor lock will also be lost when exiting full screen mode.
You can query if the cursor is currently locked by checking the lockCursor state.
To provide a good user experience it is recommended to only lock the cursor as a result of pressing a button.
Also you should check if the cursor got unlocked, in order to e.g. pause the game or bring up a game menu.
In the Web Player and Editor the cursor will automatically be unlocked when you press escape.
In the Standalone Player you have full control over mouse locking thus it won't automatically lose mouse lock unless you switch applications.
