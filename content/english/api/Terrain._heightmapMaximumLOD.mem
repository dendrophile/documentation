Lets you essentially lower the heightmap resolution used for rendering
This can be used on low end cards to never display the highest lod terrain.
A value of 0 means always showing highest detail. A value of 1 means the triangle count will be reduced to 1/4th.
The heightmap resolution will be halved for width and height.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	function Start () {
		Terrain.activeTerrain.heightmapMaximumLOD = 1;
	}
END EX
