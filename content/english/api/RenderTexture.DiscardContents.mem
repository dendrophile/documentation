Discards the contents of the RenderTexture.

On some platforms, it can be good for performance if you indicate when the
current contents of a RenderTexture aren't needed anymore. This can save
copying it from one kind of memory to another when the texture is reused.
Xbox 360 and many mobile GPUs benefit from this.
