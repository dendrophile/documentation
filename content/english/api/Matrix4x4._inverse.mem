The inverse of this matrix (RO).

Inverted matrix is such that if multiplied by the original would result
in ::ref::identity matrix.

If some matrix transforms vectors in a particular way,
then the inverse matrix can transform them back. For example,
Transform's Transform::pref::worldToLocalMatrix and Transform::pref::localToWorldMatrix
are inverses of each other.
