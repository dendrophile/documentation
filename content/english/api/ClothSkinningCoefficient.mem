The ClothSkinningCoefficient struct is used to set up how a [[SkinnedCloth]] component is allowed to move with respect to the [[SkinnedMeshRenderer]] it is attached to.
This is set using the [[SkinnedCloth.coefficients]] property on the SkinnedCloth component, which is a
per-vertex array of ClothSkinningCoefficient structs. Typically, you will not set these values from code,
but instead, set them up in the editor which shows up when you look at the SkinnedCloth component in the inspector.
