Creates an orthogonal projection matrix.

The returned matrix is such that views /left/ to /right/, /bottom/ to /top/ area, with
/zNear/ and /zFar/ depth clipping planes.

If you want to use orthogonal for pixel-correct rendering, it is better to use GL.LoadPixelMatrix,
as that would apply proper half-texel offsets for Direct3D renderer.
