Allows you to override the solver iteration count per rigidbody.
The solverIterationCount determines how accuratly joints and contacts are resolved. 
If you are having trouble with jointed bodies oscillating and behaving erratically setting 
a higher solver iteration count may improve their stability.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	rigidbody.solverIterationCount = 10;
END EX
