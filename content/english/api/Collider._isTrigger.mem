Is the collider a trigger?
A trigger doesn't collide with rigid bodies.
Instead it sends ::ref::OnTriggerEnter, ::ref::OnTriggerExit and ::ref::OnTriggerStay message
when a rigidbody enters or exits the trigger.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Turns the attached to collider into a trigger.
	collider.isTrigger = true;
END EX
