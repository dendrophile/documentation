Clear the current render buffer.

This clears the screen or the active [[RenderTexture]] you are drawing into.
In most other situations, some camera is drawing something somewhere, and probably
is clearing already with the background color of the skybox.

SA: [[GL.ClearWithSkybox]].

@param clearDepth Should the depth buffer be cleared?
@param clearColor Should the color buffer be cleared?
@param backgroundColor The color to clear with, used only if /clearColor/ is /true/.
