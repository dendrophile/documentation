Loops the value t, so that it is never larger than length and never smaller than 0.
This is similar to the modulo operator but it works with floating point numbers.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	function Update () {
		// Set the x position to loop between 0 and 3
		transform.position = Vector3(
				     Mathf.Repeat(Time.time, 3), transform.position.y, transform.position.z);
	}
END EX
