Color or depth buffer part of a [[RenderTexture]].

A single [[RenderTexture]] object represents both color and depth buffers,
but many complex rendering algorithms require using the same depth buffer
with multiple color buffers or vice versa.

This class represents either a color or a depth buffer part of a RenderTexture.

SA: RenderTexture.colorBuffer, RenderTexture.depthBuffer, Graphics.activeColorBuffer,
Graphics.activeDepthBuffer, Graphics.SetRenderTarget.
