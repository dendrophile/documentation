Sets the priority of the [[AudioSource]]
Unity is virtualizing AudioSources, when there's more AudioSources playing than available hardware channels. 
The AudioSources with lowest priority (and audibility) is virtualized first.
Priority is an integer between 0 and 256. 0=highest priority, 256=lowest priority
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// occlude this sound if we dont have hardware resources to virtualize it

	audio.priority = 256;
END EX
