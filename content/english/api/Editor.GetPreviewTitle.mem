Override this method if you want to change the label of the Preview area.
If null is returned the default text "Preview" will be used.

__Note:__ Inspector previews are limited to the primary editor of persistent objects (assets), e.g., GameObjectInspector, MaterialEditor, TextureInspector.
This means that it is currently not possible for a component to have its own inspector preview.
