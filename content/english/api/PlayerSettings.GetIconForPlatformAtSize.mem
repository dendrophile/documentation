Get the texture that will be used as the display icon at a specified size for the specified platform.

From the list of icons for the specified platform, the texture for the closest larger size will be returned, or the closest smaller size if no larger size is available.
If no icons have been assigned specifically for the specified platform, the platform-neutral default icon texture will be returned.
