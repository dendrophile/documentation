Is the game running fullscreen?
It is possible to toggle fullscreen mode by changing this property:
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Toggle fullscreen

	Screen.fullScreen = !Screen.fullScreen;
END EX
A fullscreen switch does not happen immediately; it will actually happen when the current frame is finished.
