Makes this camera's settings match other camera.

This will copy all camera's variables (field of view, clear flags, culling mask, ...) from the /other/
camera. It will also set this camera's transform to match the other camera, as well as this camera's
layer to match the layer of the other camera.

This can be useful if you want one camera to match the other camera's setup, when doing custom
rendering effects. For example when using ::ref::RenderWithShader.
