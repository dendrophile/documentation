Returns the contents of the fetched web page as a string (RO).

If the object has not finished downloading the data, it will return an empty string.
Use ::ref::isDone or /yield/ to see if the data is available.

This function expects the web page contents in UTF-8 or ASCII character set. The returned
string might be not correct for other characters or binary data. Use ::ref::bytes property to
get raw byte array in these cases.

SA: ::ref::bytes property.
