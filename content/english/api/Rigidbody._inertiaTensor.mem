The diagonal inertia tensor of mass relative to the center of mass.
The inertia tensor is rotated by the inertiaTensorRotation.
If you don't set intertia tensor from a script it will be calculated automatically from all colliders attached to the rigidbody.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// The inertia tensor of a long brick

	rigidbody.inertiaTensor = Vector3(5, 1, 1);
