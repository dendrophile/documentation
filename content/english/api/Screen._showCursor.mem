Should the cursor be visible?
It is entirely possible to implement a custom cursor instead of the system one. To do this you would
hide the system one, track mouse position or movement and display your own image in the needed place.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Hide the cursor

	Screen.showCursor = false;
END EX
