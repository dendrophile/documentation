Use this when you want to use a custom rolloff.

__Note:__ Currently is not possible to modify the volume curve via scripting.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Sets the rolloff of the audio source attached to
	// this script to custom.
	
	@script RequireComponent(AudioSource)
	function Start() {
		audio.rolloffMode = AudioRolloffMode.Custom;
	}
END EX
