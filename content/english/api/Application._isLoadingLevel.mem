Is some level being loaded? (RO)

::ref::LoadLevel and ::ref::LoadLevelAdditive don't happen immediately - a new level is loaded after the
current game frame finishes. isLoadingLevel returns /true/ if a level load was requested this frame already.

SA: ::ref::LoadLevel, ::ref::LoadLevelAdditive.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	print(Application.isLoadingLevel);
END EX
