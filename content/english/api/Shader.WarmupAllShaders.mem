Fully load all shaders to prevent future performance hiccups.

Usually graphics drivers do not actually prepare shaders until they are first needed.
However when some object is first rendered with a previously unused shader, there
can be a hiccup because the driver is compiling/optimizing the shader. This can be quite
noticeable on mobile platforms.

Calling this function will perform dummy one-invisible-triangle rendering
with all permutations of all currently loaded shaders. This can take some time but helps
to avoid hiccups in the future.
