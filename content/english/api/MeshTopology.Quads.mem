Mesh is made from quads.
Each four indices in the mesh index buffer form a quadrangular face.
Note that quad topology is emulated on many platforms, so it's more efficient
to use a triangular mesh. Unless you really need quads, for example if using
DirectX 11 tessellation shaders that operate on quad patches.
