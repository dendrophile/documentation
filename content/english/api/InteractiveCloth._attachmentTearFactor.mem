How far attached rigid bodies need to be stretched, before they will tear off.
Must be larger then zero. Larger values make the cloth stretch further without tearing.
Only has an affect for rigid bodies which have been attached with the tearable parameter set.

SA: ::ref::AttachToCollider function.

	transform.GetComponent(InteractiveCloth).attachmentTearFactor = 10;
