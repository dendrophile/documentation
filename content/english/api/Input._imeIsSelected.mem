Does the user have an IME keyboard input source selected?
This returns true if the users keyboard is currently configured for IME input, and false otherwise.
Since users of asian languages can typically turn IME conversion on or off using a keystroke, it is useful
to provide some visual indication of IME being enabled. This can be done by checking Input.imeIsSelected.
