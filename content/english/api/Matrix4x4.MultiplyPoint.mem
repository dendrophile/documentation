Transforms a position by this matrix (generic).

Returns a position /v/ transformed by the current fully arbitrary matrix.
If the matrix is a regular 3D transformation matrix, it is much faster to
use ::ref::MultiplyPoint3x4 instead. /MultiplyPoint/ is slower, but can handle
projective transformations as well.

SA: ::ref::MultiplyPoint3x4, ::ref::MultiplyVector.
