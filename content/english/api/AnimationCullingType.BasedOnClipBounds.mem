Animation is disabled when Animation::ref::localBounds are not visible.
When this type of culling is used Animation::ref::localBounds will be based on bounds of attached clips
which are precalculated on import. This culling method works better 
than BasedOnRenderers, because animation can push itself into the camera frustum.
SA: ::ref::BasedOnUserBounds, Animation::ref::localBounds property, AnimationClip::ref::localBounds property
