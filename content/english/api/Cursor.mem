Cursor API for setting the cursor that is used for rendering.
Supports Hardware Cursors on OSX and Windows, falls back to software cursors on unsupported platforms.

Textures used as cursors should be marked as such in their import settings. 

OSX Webplayer note: Due to sandboxing, Hardware Cursors can only be updated intermittently (when the cursor is moving)
the best way to ensure correct behavior if to use OnMouseEnter and OnMouseExit to set the hardware cursors. This is not
an issue for software cursors.
