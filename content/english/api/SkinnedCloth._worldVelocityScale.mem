How much world-space movement of the character will affect cloth vertices.
The higher this value is, the more the cloth will move as a reaction to world space movement of the GameObject.
Basically, this defines the air friction of the SkinnedCloth.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	GetComponent(SkinnedCloth).worldVelocityScale = 0.5;
END EX
