The current vertex positions of the cloth object.
This gives you read access to the vertex positions of the cloth object, so you can analyse it's current simulation state.
Note that the vertex indices may not necessarily correspond to the indices of the source mesh - especially when triangle stripping
or UV seams are used in the source mesh (ie, multiple indices for the same vertex), cloth vertices will be different, as the cloth
simulation only uses a single index for each vertex.
