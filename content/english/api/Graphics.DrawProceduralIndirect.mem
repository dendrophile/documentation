Draws a fully procedural geometry on the GPU.

DrawProceduralIndirect does a draw call on the GPU, without any vertex or index buffers.
The amount of geometry to draw is read from a [[ComputeBuffer]]. Typical use
case is generating arbitrary amount of data from a [[ComputeShader]] and
then rendering that, without requiring a readback to the CPU.

This is only useful on DirectX 11 level hardware where shaders can read
arbitrary data from [[ComputeBuffer]] buffers.
