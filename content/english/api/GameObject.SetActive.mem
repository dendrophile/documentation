Activates/Deactivates the GameObject.

Note that a GameObject may be inactive because a parent is not active. In that case,
calling SetActive() will not activate it, but only set the local state of the GameObject, which
can be checked using [[GameObject.activeSelf]]. This state will then be used once all parents are
active.
SA: [[GameObject.activeSelf]], [[GameObject.activeInHierarchy]]

BEGIN EX

	// Deactivates the game object.
	gameObject.SetActive (false);
END EX
