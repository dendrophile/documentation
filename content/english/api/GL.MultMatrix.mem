Multiplies the current modelview matrix with the one specified.

Equivalent to @@glMultMatrix(mat)@@ in OpenGL; in other graphics APIs the
corresponding functionality is emulated.

Changing modelview matrix overrides current camera's view parameters, so most
often you want to save and restore matrix using GL.PushMatrix and GL.PopMatrix.
