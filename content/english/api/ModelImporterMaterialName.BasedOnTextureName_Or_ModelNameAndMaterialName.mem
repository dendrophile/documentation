<textureName>.mat or <modelFileName>-<materialName>.mat material name.

Name materials <textureName>.mat (i.e. diffuse texture name of imported material) when searching for existing or creating new materials. If material 
doesn't have a texture or texture doesn't exist in Unity project folder in one of Textures folders, then material will be named 
<modelFileName>-<materialName>.mat instead. This option has behaviour compatible with Unity 3.4 and earlier versions 
(i.e. same behaviour as ModelImporterGenerateMaterials.PerTexture).
