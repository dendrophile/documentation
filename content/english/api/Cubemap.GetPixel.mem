Returns pixel color at coordinates (face, x, y).

If the pixel coordinates are out of bounds (larger than width/height or small than 0),
they will be clamped or repeat based on the texture's wrap mode.

The texture must have the __Is Readable__ flag set in the import settings, otherwise this function will fail.

BEGIN EX

	// prints the color of the pixel at (0,0) of the +X face
	var c : Cubemap;
	Debug.Log(c.GetPixel(CubemapFace.PositiveX, 0, 0));
END EX
