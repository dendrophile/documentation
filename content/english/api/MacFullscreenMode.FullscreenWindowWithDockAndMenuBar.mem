Fullscreen window with Dock and Menu bar.
Same as Fullscreen window mode, but Unity will also show the Menu bar and Dock if the cursor moves to the 
edges of the screen, like other OS X fullscreen Apps. It is possible to switch between fullscreen and windowed 
modes using the fullscreen button in the window title bar (or in the menu bar in fullscreen mode).
