A [[SerializedObject]] representing the object or objects being inspected.

The serializedObject can be used inside the ::ref::OnInspectorGUI function of a custom Editor as described on the page about the [[Editor]] class.

The serializedObject should not be used inside ::ref::OnSceneGUI or ::ref::OnPreviewGUI. Use the target property directly in those callback functions instead.
