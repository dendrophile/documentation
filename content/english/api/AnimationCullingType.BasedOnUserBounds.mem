Animation is disabled when Animation::ref::localBounds are not visible.
Animation::ref::localBounds can be set by user, when culling is set to BasedOnUserBounds.
This culling method works better than BasedOnRenderers, because animation can push itself into the camera frustum.
SA: ::ref::BasedOnClipBounds, Animation::ref::localBounds property
