Animation is disabled when renderers are not visible.
The statemachine and root motion will always be evaluated. Thus you will always receive the OnAnimatorMove callbacks.
All other animation will be skipped if the character is not visible.
Specifically evaluation of bone animation, IK, OnAnimatorIK will be skipped.
