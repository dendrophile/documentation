The current modelview matrix.

Assigning to this variable is equivalent to @@glLoadMatrix(mat)@@ in OpenGL; in other
graphics APIs the corresponding functionality is emulated.

Changing modelview matrix overrides current camera's view parameters, so most
often you want to save and restore matrix using GL.PushMatrix and GL.PopMatrix.

Reading this variable returns the current modelview matrix.
