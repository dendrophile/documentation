In the Build Settings dialog there is a check box called "Development Build".
If it is checked isDebugBuild will be true.
In the editor /isDebugBuild/ always returns true.
It is recommended to remove all calls to Debug.Log when deploying a game, this way you can
easily deploy beta builds with debug prints and final builds without.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Log some debug information only if this is a debug build
	if (Debug.isDebugBuild) {
		Debug.Log ("This is a debug build!");
	}
END EX
