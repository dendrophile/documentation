Samples animations at the current state.
This is useful when you explicitly want to set up some animation state, and sample it once.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Set up some state;
	animation["MyClip"].time = 2.0;
	animation["MyClip"].enabled = true;
	// Sample animations now.
	animation.Sample();

	animation["MyClip"].enabled = false;
END EX
