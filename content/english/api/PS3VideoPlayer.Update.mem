Updates the video.
If the PS3VideoPlayer.Init was called with a valid RenderTexture then update should be called in Camera.OnPostRender
If the PS3VideoPlayer.Init was not called, then you can call it in either Camera.OnPreRender or Camera.OnPostRender
Please note that Camera.OnPreRender is executed before the camera clear.
SA: [[RenderTexture]], Camera.OnPreRender, Camera.OnPostRender, PS3VideoPlayer.Init
