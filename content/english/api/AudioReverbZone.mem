Reverb Zones are used when you want to gradually change from a point
where there is no ambient effect to a place where there is one. for example 
you can gradually change your character's footsteps sounds and create the
feeling like you where entering into a cavern, going trough a room,
swimming underwater, etc.

You can always mix reverb zones to have combined effects.
