The Audio Chorus Filter takes an Audio Clip and processes it creating a chorus effect.

The chorus effect modulates the original sound by a sinusoid low frequency
oscillator (LFO). The output sounds like there are multiple sources emitting
the same sound with slight variations - resembling a choir.

__Note:__ This filter is only available on the PRO version.
