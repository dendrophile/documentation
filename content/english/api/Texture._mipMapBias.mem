Mip map bias of the texture.

A positive bias makes a texture appear extra blurry, while a negative bias sharpens
the texture. Note that using large negative bias can reduce performance, so it's not
recommended to use more than -0.5 negative bias. In most cases better sharpening of the texture
can be achieved by using anisotropic filtering.
