Builds an asset bundle, with custom names for the assets __(Unity Pro only)__.
Creates a compressed unity3d file that contains a collection of /assets/. AssetBundles can contain any asset found in the project folder.
In the /assetNames/ parameter, supply an array of strings of the same size as the number of assets.
These will be used as asset names, which you can then pass to AssetBundle.Load to load a specific asset.
Use ::ref::BuildAssetBundle to just use the asset's path names instead.
The compressed asset bundle file will be saved at /pathName/.
/options/ allows you to automatically include dependencies or always include complete assets instead of just the exact referenced objects.
