Set look at weights
@param weight    (0-1) the global weight of the LookAt, multiplier for other parameters
@param bodyWeight    (0-1) determines how much the body is involved in the LookAt
@param headWeight     (0-1) determines how much the head is involved in the LookAt
@param eyesWeight     (0-1) determines how much the eyes are involved in the LookAt
@param clampWeight    (0-1) 0.0 means the character is completely unrestrained in motion, 1.0 means he's completely clamped (look at becomes impossible), and 0.5 means he'll be able to move on half of the possible range (180 degrees).
