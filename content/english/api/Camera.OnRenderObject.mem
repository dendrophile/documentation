CSNONE
OnRenderObject is called after camera has rendered the scene.

This can be used to render your own objects using Graphics.DrawMeshNow or other functions.
This function is similar to ::ref::OnPostRender, except OnRenderObject is called on any object
that has a script with the function; no matter if it's attached to a Camera or not.
