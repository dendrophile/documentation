Returns a list with 'root' and all its direct children.
Note that this is used instead of GetComponentsInChildren<ParticleSystem>() 
which could return incorrect results because one hieararchy could be somewhere below another hiearchy.
In this case it would return Particle Systems of both hierarchies.

SA: GetRoot
