CSNONE
This is called by Unity when it is about to delete an asset from disk.
If this is implemented, it allows you to delete the asset yourself.
Deletion of a file can be prevented by returning AssetDeleteResult.FailedDelete
You should not call any Unity AssetDatabase api from within this callback, preferably keep to file operations or VCS apis.
