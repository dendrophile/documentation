Controls whether physics will change the rotation of the object.
If freezeRotation is enabled, the rotation is not modified by the physics simulation.
This is useful for creating first person shooters,
because the player needs full control of the rotation using the mouse.

BEGIN EX

	// Freeze the rotation
