Is texture data readable from scripts.

Texture has to be set as "readable" in order for Texture2D.GetPixel, Texture2D.GetPixels and similar functions
to work. Textures are __not__ set as readable by default.

When texture is not readable, it consumes much less memory, because a system-memory copy does not have
to be kept around after texture is uploaded to the graphics API.
