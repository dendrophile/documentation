The position of the rigidbody.
This is similar to setting transform.position, however the position will only be applied to the transform at the end of the physics step.
If you want to continously move a rigidbody or kinematic rigidbody use MovePosition and MoveRotation instead
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	function Start () {
		rigidbody.position = Vector3.zero;
	}
END EX
