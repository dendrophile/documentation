Pixel inset used for pixel adjustments for size and position.
You can set the transform.localScale to Vector3.zero in order to make the GUI texture always the same pixel size.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	transform.position = Vector3.zero;
	transform.localScale = Vector3.zero;
	guiTexture.pixelInset = Rect (50, 50, 100, 100);
END EX
