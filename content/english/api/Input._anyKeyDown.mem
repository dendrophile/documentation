Returns true the first frame the user hits any key or mouse button. (RO)
You should be polling this variable from the MonoBehaviour::pref::Update function, since the state gets reset each frame.
It will not return true until the user has released all keys / buttons and pressed any key / buttons again.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Detects if any key has been pressed down.

	function Update() {
		if(Input.anyKeyDown)
			Debug.Log("A key or mouse click has been detected");
	}
END EX
