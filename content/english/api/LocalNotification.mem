LocalNotification is a wrapper around the UILocalNotification class found in the Apple UIKit framework and is only available on iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch.

It represents notifications that an application can schedule for presentation to its user at specific dates and times. 
The operating system is responsible for delivering the notification at the specified time. 
Local notifications are similar to remote notifications but are scheduled and delivered locally and do not require connection with remote servers.

Local notifications are scheduled and handled using NotificationServices class.
