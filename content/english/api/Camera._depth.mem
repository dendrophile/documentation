Camera's depth in the camera rendering order.
Cameras with lower depth are rendered before cameras with higher depth.

Use this to control the order in which cameras are drawn if you have multiple cameras and some of them don't cover the full screen.
SA: [[wiki:class-Camera|camera component]], Camera.rect property.

BEGIN EX

	// Set this camera to render after the main camera

	camera.depth = Camera.main.depth + 1;
