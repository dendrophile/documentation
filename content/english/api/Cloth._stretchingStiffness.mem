Stretching stiffness of the cloth.
Must be greater than zero and smaller or equal to one.\\
In many cases, when you want a cloth to be more stiff, actually reducing the number of vertices
will get you better results - and performance.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Set the stretching Stiffness to 1 regardless if the cloth
	// is a Skinned Cloth or Interactive.

	transform.GetComponent(Cloth).stretchingStiffness = 1;
END EX
