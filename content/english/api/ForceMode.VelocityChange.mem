Add an instant velocity change to the rigidbody, ignoring its mass.
Apply the velocity change instantly with a single function call. In contrast to ForceMode.Impulse, VelocityChange will change the velocity of every rigidbody the same way regardless of differences in mass.
This mode is useful for something like a fleet of differently-sized space ships that you want to control without accounting for differences in mass.
In this mode, the unit of the force parameter is applied to the rigidbody as distance/time.
