Property indicating whether keypresses are eaten by a textinput if it has focus (default true).
This will avoid keypresses seeping through to the underlying gameview.
This property must be set to false for anyKey or GetKey to work while a textfield has focus.
IME input in the Mac OS X web plugin is disabled when this is set to false.
