When using HDR rendering it can sometime be desirable to switch to LDR rendering during ImageEffect rendering.
Using this Attribute on an image effect will cause the destination buffer to be an LDR buffer, and switch the
rest of the Image Effect pipeline into LDR mode. It is the responsibility of the Image Effect that this Attribute
is associated to ensure that the output is in the LDR range.
