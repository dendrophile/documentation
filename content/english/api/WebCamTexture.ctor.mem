Create a WebCamTexture
Note that if you want to use WebCamTextures in the web player, you need to get the user's
permission to do so. Call [[Application.RequestUserAuthorization]] before creating a
WebCamTexture.
@param deviceName the name of the video input device to be used. Use [[WebCamTexture.devices]] to get a list of supported devices. 
If no device is supplied by either using one of the constructors which don't have this parameter, or by passing null, the first device
to be found will be used.
@param requestedWidth the requested width of the texture. The real width may be different, and will match the closest width supported by the device.
@param requestedHeight the requested height of the texture. The real height may be different, and will match the closest height supported by the device.
@param requestedFPS the requested frame rate of the texture. The real frame rate may be different, and will match the closest frame rate supported by the device.
