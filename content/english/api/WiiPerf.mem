Wii performance indicators, metrics and memory usage.
Performance metrics and indicators are  disabled by default. When enabled you can either use values from the scripts and/or enable head-up display to show CPU/GPU utilization bars on screen. As enabling performance measurement might slightly affect performance, enable it only when needed.
