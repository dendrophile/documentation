How far the character has travelled until it hit the collider.
Note that this can is different from what you pass to CharacterController.Move,
because all movement is constrained by collisions.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	function OnControllerColliderHit(hit : ControllerColliderHit) {
		Debug.Log(hit.moveLength);
	}
END EX
