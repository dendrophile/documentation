Maximum number of trees rendered at full LOD.
This is an easy setting to prevent too many trees being rendered at too high resolution in dense forests.
Since there will be no fade if /treeMaximumFullLODCount/ is exceeded you should tweak the /treeBillboardDistance/ to 
not include unnecessary trees that are not being seen but, still rendered.

BEGIN EX

	function Start () {
		Terrain.activeTerrain.treeMaximumFullLODCount = 200;
	}
END EX
