Add binary data to the form.

Use this function to upload files and images to a web server application.
Note that the data is read from the contents of byte array and not from a file.
The fileName parameter is for telling the server what filename to use when saving the uploaded file.

If /mimeType/ is not given and first 8 bytes of the data match PNG format header, then the
data is sent with "@@image/png@@" mimetype. Otherwise it is sent with "@@application/octet-stream@@"
mimetype.
