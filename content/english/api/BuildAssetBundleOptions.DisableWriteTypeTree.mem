Do not include type information within the AssetBundle.
Specifying this flag will make an AssetBundle susceptible to script or Unity version changes, but will make the file smaller and a bit faster to load.
This flag affects only AssetBundles for platforms that have type information included by default. Mobile and console platform always build without type information.
Type information must be present for Web platforms, therefore Unity will reject to build an AssetBundle if you specify this flag when building for BuildTarget.WebPlayer, for example.
