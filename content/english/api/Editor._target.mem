The object being inspected.

For editors that support multi-object editing, the target property should not be used inside ::ref::OnInspectorGUI since it only refers to the first of the edited objects.
It should still be used in ::ref::OnSceneGUI and ::ref::OnPreviewGUI, which will be called once for each of the selected objects with the target property referring to each of them in turn.
