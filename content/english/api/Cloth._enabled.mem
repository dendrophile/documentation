Is this cloth enabled?
This is the same as the checkbox next to the component label in the inspector.
A disabled cloth component will not update it's physics simulation, so you can use this to suspend the simulation of cloth
objects when they are not needed, as cloth simulation is a very CPU-intensive task.

	GetComponent(InteractiveCloth).enabled = false;
