Deletes all lightmap assets and makes all lights behave as if they weren't baked yet.
Only those assets are deleted that are in the folder with the same name as the scene name
AND their name follows the pattern LightmapFar-#.exr or LightmapNear-#.exr.

If LightmapEditorSettings.lockAtlas is disabled, it will also clear the lightmaps array and
clear lightmap indices on all objects.

Baked light probes are cleared as well.
