Force cone friction to be used for this rigidbody.
This insures that all contacts involving the actor will use cone friction. This will however have a negative impact on 
performance. By default this is off and a much faster and almost as good approximation called pyramid friction method is used.
In most cases it is recommended to leave this value off.
