Is the render texture actually created?

RenderTexture constructor does not actually create the hardware texture;
by default the texture is created the first time it is set ::ref::active.
@@IsCreated@@ returns /true/ if the hardware resources for this render
are created.

SA: ::ref::Create, ::ref::Release functions.
