Data buffer to hold data for compute shaders.

[[ComputeShader]] programs often need arbitrary data to be read & written into memory buffers.
ComputeBuffer class is exactly for that - you can create & fill them from script code,
and use them in compute shaders or regular shaders.

Compute shaders need a fairly modern GPU and are only available when using DirectX 11 right now.
