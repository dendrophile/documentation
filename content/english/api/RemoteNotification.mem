RemoteNotification is only available on iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch.

Remote notifications are sent by an application's remote server (its provider) to Apple Push Notification service 
which pushes the notification to devices on which the application is installed.

Remote notifications are registered for and handled using NotificationServices class.
