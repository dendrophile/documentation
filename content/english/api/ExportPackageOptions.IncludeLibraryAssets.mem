The exported package will include all library assets, ie. the project settings located in the Library folder of the project.
This is useful for exporting an entire project in a single unitypackage:
BEGIN EX

	AssetDatabase.ExportPackage("Assets/", "Entire Project.unitypackage", ExportPackageOptions.Recurse | ExportPackageOptions.IncludeLibraryAssets );
END EX
