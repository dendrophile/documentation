Returns the type of Internet reachability currently possible on the device.

This property is mostly useful on handhelds to distinguish fast and
cheap WiFi connection from carrier networking.

Note: Do not use this property to determine the actual connectivity.
E.g. the device can be connected to a hot spot, but not have the actual
route to the network. Non-handhelds are considered to always be capable
of [[NetworkReachability.ReachableViaLocalAreaNetwork]].
