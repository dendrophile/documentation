The maximum number of pixel lights that should affect any object.
If there are more lights illuminating an object, the dimmest ones will be rendered
as vertex lights.

Use this from scripting if you want to have finer control than offered by quality settings
levels.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Use at most one pixel light for every object

	QualitySettings.pixelLightCount = 1;
END EX
