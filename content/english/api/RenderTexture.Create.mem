Actually creates the RenderTexture.

RenderTexture constructor does not actually create the hardware texture;
by default the texture is created the first time it is set ::ref::active.
Calling @@Create@@ lets you create it up front. @@Create@@ does nothing
if the texture is already created.

SA: ::ref::Release, ::ref::IsCreated functions.
