How much force will be applied to colliding rigidbodies?
If this is greater then zero, interaction of the cloth with colliding rigidbodies is enabled.
The higher this value is, the greater the forces applied to rigidbodies are. 
It is recommended to start out with small values (like 0.2) for best results.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Make the cloth apply forces on what it touches.

	transform.GetComponent(InteractiveCloth).collisionResponse = 0.2;
END EX
