Get rendering info for a specific character
Note: You should only ever need to use this when you want to implement your own text rendering.
If the character /ch/ with the specified /size/ and /style/ is present in the font texture, then this method will
return true, and info will contain the texture placement information for that character. If the character is not
present, this method returns false. If /size/ is zero, it will use the default size for the font.
