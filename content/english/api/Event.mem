A UnityGUI event.

Events correspond to user input (key presses, mouse actions), or are UnityGUI layout or rendering events.

For each event MonoBehaviour::pref::OnGUI is called in the scripts; so OnGUI is potentially
called multiple times per frame. Event.current corresponds to "current" event inside OnGUI call.
