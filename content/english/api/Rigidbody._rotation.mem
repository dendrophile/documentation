The rotation of the rigdibody.
This is similar to setting transform.rotation, however the rotation will only be applied to the transform at the end of the physics step.
If you want to continously move a rigidbody or kinematic rigidbody use ::ref::MovePosition and ::ref::MoveRotation instead.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	function Start () {
		rigidbody.rotation = Quaternion.identity;
	}
END EX
