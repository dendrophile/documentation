Moves a value /current/ towards /target/.
This is essentially the same as Mathf.Lerp but instead the function will ensure that the speed never exceeds /maxDelta/.
Negative values of /maxDelta/ pushes the value away from /target/.

BEGIN EX

	var target = 20.0;
	var speed = 5.0;
	
	function Update() {
		transform.position = Vector3(Mathf.MoveTowards
			(transform.position.x, target, speed * Time.deltaTime), 0, 0);
	}
END EX
