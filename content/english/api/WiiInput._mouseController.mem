Index of the Wii Remote controller which will emulate the mouse.
Index is not changed automatically, eg. when the second remote of two is disconnected, mouse pointer stops. Use [[WiiInput.Probe]] to check whether a remote is connected to the console.<br><br>
Assign -1 if you do not want the cursor position to be automatically attached to a Wii Controller's pointer position nor GUI events to be generated. Button presses are still sent to the Input manager as well as Nunckuk's button presses or joystick movements. SA: Event.QueueEvent. Additionally, a static method ProcessInput.PreprocessInput () is called (if such exists) every frame after the input data has been gathered from input devices but before processed by the Input manager. See code example in Event.QueueEvent description for a script that applies movement and button data to the Input manager and generates GUI events.
