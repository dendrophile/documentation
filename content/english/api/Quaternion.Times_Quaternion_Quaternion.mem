Combines rotations /lhs/ and /rhs/.

Rotating a point first with /lhs/ and then with /rhs/ is the same as rotating the point by the combined rotation.
Note that rotations are not commutative: ''lhs * rhs'' does not equal to ''rhs * lhs''.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Applies the rotation of
	// extraRotation to the current rotation

	var extraRotation : Transform;
	transform.rotation *= extraRotation.rotation;
END EX
