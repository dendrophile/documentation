Builds an asset bundle using a hash for the id of the object stored in the asset bundle.
This allows you to rebuild an asset bundle and reference assets in it directly.
When rebuilding the asset bundle the objects in it are guaranteed to have the same id
after rebuilding the asset bundle.
Due to it being a 32 bit hash space, if you have a lot of objects in the asset bundle it will increase the potential for hash conflicts. Unity will give an error and not build the asset bundle in that case.
The hash is based on the GUID of the asset and the local id of the object in the asset.
DeterministicAssetBundle are also slower to load from than normal asset bundles, this is because the threaded background loading API usually expects objects to be ordered in a way that makes reading reduce seeking.
With DeterministicAssetBundles that is not possible.
