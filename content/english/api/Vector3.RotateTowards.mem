Rotates a vector /current/ towards /target/.
The vector will be rotated on an arc instead of being interpolated linearly.
This is essentially the same as Vector3.Slerp but instead the function will ensure that the angular speed and change of magnitude never exceeds /maxRadiansDelta/ and /maxMagnitudeDelta/.
Negative values of /maxRadiansDelta/ and /maxMagnitudeDelta/ pushes the vector away from /target/.
