Create an editable copy of the font asset at /path/.
Use this function if you want to modify the font generated by the TrueTypeFontImporter, with a custom texture
or otherwise. It will create a copy of the font asset at /path/ with an accompanying png Texture file and a
Material, which you can all modify to meet your needs. A reference to the newly created editable Font is
returned.
