Creates a rotation which rotates from /fromDirection/ to /toDirection/.
Usually you use this to rotate a transform so that one of its axes eg. the y-axis - follows a target direction /toDirection/ in world space.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Sets the rotation so that the transform's y-axis goes along the z-axis

	transform.rotation = Quaternion.FromToRotation (Vector3.up, transform.forward);
END EX
