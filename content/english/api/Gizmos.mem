Gizmos are used to give visual debugging or setup aids in the scene view.

All gizmo drawing has to be done in either MonoBehaviour::pref::OnDrawGizmos or
MonoBehaviour::pref::OnDrawGizmosSelected functions of the script.

__OnDrawGizmos__ is called every frame. All gizmos rendered within OnDrawGizmos are pickable.\\
__OnDrawGizmosSelected__ is called only if the object the script is attached to is selected.
