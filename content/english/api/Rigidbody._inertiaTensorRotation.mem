The rotation of the inertia tensor.
If you don't set intertia tensor rotation from a script it will be calculated automatically from all colliders attached to the rigidbody.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Resets the inertia tensor to be the coordinate system of the transform

	rigidbody.inertiaTensorRotation = Quaternion.identity;
END EX
