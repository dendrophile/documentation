Returns pixel color at coordinates (x, y).

If the pixel coordinates are out of bounds (larger than width/height or small than 0),
they will be clamped or repeat based on the texture's wrap mode.

If you are reading a large block of pixels from the texture, it may be faster
to use ::ref::GetPixels which returns a whole block of pixel colors.
