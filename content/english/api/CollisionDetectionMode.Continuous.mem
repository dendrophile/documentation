Continuous collision detection is on for colliding with static mesh geometry.
Collisions will be detected for any static mesh geometry in the path of this Rigidbody, even if the collision occurs
between two FixedUpdate steps. Static mesh geometry is any MeshCollider which does not have a Rigidbody attached.
This also prevent Rigidbodies set to ContinuousDynamic mode from passing through this Rigidbody.
