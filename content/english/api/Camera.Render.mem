Render the camera manually.

This will render the camera. It will use the camera's clear flags, target texture and all other settings.

The camera will send MonoBehaviour::pref::OnPreCull, MonoBehaviour::pref::OnPreRender &
MonoBehaviour::pref::OnPostRender to any scripts attached, and render any eventual image filters.

This is used for taking precise control of render order. To make use of this feature, create a 
camera and disable it. Then call Render on it.
