Transforms a position by this matrix (fast).

Returns a position /v/ transformed by the current transformation matrix.
This function is a faster version of ::ref::MultiplyPoint; but it can only
handle regular 3D transformations. /MultiplyPoint/ is slower, but can handle
projective transformations as well.

SA: ::ref::MultiplyPoint, ::ref::MultiplyVector.
