If enabled and baked light probes are present in the scene, an interpolated light probe
will be calculated for this object and set as built-in shader uniform variables.
Surface shaders use this information automatically. To add light probe contribution to
your custom non-surface shaders, use ShadeSH9(worldSpaceNormal) in your vertex or pixel shader.
