Set a named vector value.

Four component vectors and colors are the same in Unity shaders. /SetVector/ does exactly the same
as ::ref::SetColor just the input data type is different (@@xyzw@@ in the vector becomes @@rgba@@ in the color).

SA: ::ref::SetColor, ::ref::GetVector.

BEGIN EX

	renderer.material.SetVector("_Color", Vector4(0,0,1,1));
