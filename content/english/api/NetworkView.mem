The network view is the binding material of multiplayer games.
With this you can define exactly what is to be synchronized over the network and how
it should be done. Game objects can have NetworkView components which can be
configured to watch other components for the object. 
For more information see the [[wiki:net-NetworkView| Network View manual page]] and the [[wiki:class-NetworkView|component reference page]].
