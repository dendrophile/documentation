The normalized playback speed.
This is most commonly used to synchronize playback speed when blending between two animations.
In most cases it is easier and better to use animation.SyncLayer instead.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Sync run and walk speed
	animation["Run"].normalizedSpeed = animation["Walk"].speed;
END EX
