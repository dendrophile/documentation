Skinning bone weights of a vertex in the mesh.

Each vertex is skinned with up to four bones. All weights should sum up to one.
Weights and bone indices should be defined in the order of decreasing weight.
If a vertex is affected by less than four bones, the remaining weights should be zeroes.

SA: Mesh.boneWeights variable.
