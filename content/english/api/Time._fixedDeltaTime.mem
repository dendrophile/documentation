The interval in seconds at which physics and other fixed frame rate updates (like MonoBehaviour's MonoBehaviour::pref::FixedUpdate) are performed.

For reading the delta time it is recommended to use Time.deltaTime instead because it automatically
returns the right delta time if you are inside a MonoBehaviour::pref::FixedUpdate function or
MonoBehaviour::pref::Update function.

Note that the /fixedDeltaTime/ interval is with respect to the in-game time affected by ::ref::timeScale.
