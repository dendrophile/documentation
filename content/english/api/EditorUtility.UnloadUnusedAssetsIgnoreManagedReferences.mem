Unloads assets that are not used, including the ones that are referenced only from scripts.
Similarly to UnloadUnusedAssets it will unload unused assets, but additionally it will also unload assets that are
referenced only by the script properties or static variables. The unloaded assets will be loaded again on the first use.
