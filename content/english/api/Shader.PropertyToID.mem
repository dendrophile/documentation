Gets unique identifier for a shader property name.

Shader property identifiers are used by [[MaterialPropertyBlock]] functions.

Each name of shader property (for example, @@_MainTex@@ or @@_Color@@) is assigned an unique
integer number in Unity, that stays the same for the whole game.

SA: [[MaterialPropertyBlock]].
