Mouse was moved (editor views only).
The mouse was moved without any buttons being held down. Use Event.mousePosition and Event.delta to determine mouse motion.

Note that this even is only sent in the Editor, for [[EditorWindow]] windows which have EditorWindow.wantsMouseMove
set to true. Mouse move events are never sent in the games.
