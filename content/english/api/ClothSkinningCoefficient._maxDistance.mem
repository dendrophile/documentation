Distance a vertex is allowed to travel from the skinned mesh vertex position.
The SkinnedCloth component makes sure
that the cloth vertices stay within maxDistance from the skinned mesh vertex positions. 
If maxDistance is zero, the vertex is not simulated but set to the skinned mesh vertex position.
This behavior is useful for attaching the cloth vertex to the skin of an animated character.	
Default: 0.2
Range: [0, inf)
