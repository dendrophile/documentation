The rotation of the transform relative to the parent transform's rotation.

Unity stores rotations as Quaternions internally. To rotate an object, use Transform.Rotate.
Use Transform.localEulerAngles for modifying the rotation as euler angles.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Set the rotation to be the same as the parent
	transform.localRotation = Quaternion.identity;
END EX
