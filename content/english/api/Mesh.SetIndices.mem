Sets the index buffer for the submesh.
A submesh is simply a separate indices array. When the mesh renderer uses multiple materials, you should
ensure that there are as many submeshes as materials.

::ref::SetTriangles and ::triangles always make the mesh be composed of triangles
faces. Using SetIndices you can create a mesh that's made out of lines or points,
see [[MeshTopology]] enum.

SA: ::ref::subMeshCount, [[MeshTopology]] enum.
