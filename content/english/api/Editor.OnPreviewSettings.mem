Override this method if you want to show custom controls in the preview header.
The default implementation is a no-op.

__Note:__ Inspector previews are limited to the primary editor of persistent objects (assets), e.g., GameObjectInspector, MaterialEditor, TextureInspector.
This means that it is currently not possible for a component to have its own inspector preview.
