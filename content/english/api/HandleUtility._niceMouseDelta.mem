Get nice mouse delta to use for dragging a float value (RO).
This will autodetect the users preference for X / Y axis dragging and give you back
a float that is measured accordingly. This also handles modifier keys correctly, i.e.
the delta is already multiplied by ::ref::acceleration.

SA: ::ref::acceleration, ::ref::niceMouseDeltaZoom.
