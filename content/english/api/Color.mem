Representation of RGBA colors.
This structure is used throughout Unity to pass colors around. 
Each color component is a floating point value with a range from 0 to 1.

Components (::ref::r,::ref::g,::ref::b) define a color in RGB color space. Alpha component (::ref::a)
defines transparency - alpha of one is completely opaque, alpha of zero is completely
transparent.
