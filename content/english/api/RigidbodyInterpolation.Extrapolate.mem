Extrapolation will predict the position of the rigidbody based on the current velocity.
If you have fast moving objects this can lead to rigidbodies passing 
through colliders for one frame and then snapping back.

SA: Rigidbody.interpolation variable.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	rigidbody.interpolation = RigidbodyInterpolation.Extrapolate;
END EX
