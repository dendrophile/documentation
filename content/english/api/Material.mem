The material class.

This class exposes all properties from a material, allowing you to animate them.
You can also use it to set custom shader properties that can't be accessed through
the inspector (e.g. matrices).

In order to get the material used by an object, use the Renderer.material property:
SA: [[wiki:Materials]], [[wiki:Shaders|ShaderLab documentation]].
