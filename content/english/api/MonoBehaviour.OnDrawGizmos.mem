CSNONE
Implement this OnDrawGizmos if you want to draw gizmos that are also pickable and always drawn.
This allows you to quickly pick important objects in your scene.

Note that OnDrawGizmos will use a mouse position that is relative to the Scene View.

BEGIN EX

	// Draws the Light bulb icon at position of the object.

	function OnDrawGizmos () {
		Gizmos.DrawIcon (transform.position, "Light Gizmo.tiff");
