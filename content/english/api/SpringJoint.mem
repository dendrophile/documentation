The spring joint ties together 2 rigid bodies, spring forces will be automatically applied to keep the object at the given distance.

The Spring attempts to maintain the distance it has when it starts out.
So if your joint's start at a rest position where the two rigidbodies are far apart, then the joint will attempt to maintain that distance.
The minDistance and maxDistance properties add on top of this implicit distance.
