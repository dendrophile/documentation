Reads the buffer to "mountName:\unity.buf".
Returns false if a storage operation is already active by checking /IsStorageOpActive/ or if file could not be written.
/IsStorageOpActive/ will return true during the operation.
/onComplete/ is never called if this function returns false.
WARNING: calling WriteBuffer will NOT create a copy of the passed-in /buffer/, instead the same instance will be used. Make sure it is not deleted or modified before /onComplete/ is called.
