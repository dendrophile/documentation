Unloads all assets in the bundle.

Unload frees all the memory associated with the objects inside the bundle.

When /unloadAllLoadedObjects/ is false, compressed file data for assets inside the bundle will be unloaded, but any actual objects already loaded
from this bundle will be kept intact. Of course you won't be able to load any more objects from this bundle.

When /unloadAllLoadedObjects/ is true, all objects that were loaded from this bundle will be destroyed as well. If there are game
objects in your scene referencing those assets, the references to them will become missing.
