Representation of 3D vectors and points.
This structure is used throughout Unity to pass 3D positions and directions around.
It also contains functions for doing common vector operations.

Besides the functions listed below, other classes can be used to manipulate vectors and points as well.
For example the [[Quaternion]] and the [[Matrix4x4]] classes are useful for rotating or transforming vectors and points.
