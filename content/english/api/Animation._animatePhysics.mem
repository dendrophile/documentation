When turned on, animations will be executed in the physics loop. This is only useful in conjunction with kinematic rigidbodies.
An animated platform can apply velocity and friction to rigid bodies sitting on top of it.
In order to use this,  animatePhysics must be enabled and animated object must be a kinematic rigid body.
