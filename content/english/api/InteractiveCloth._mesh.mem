The mesh used as base for the cloth object.
Changing this property causes the cloth simulation to reset.
For best performance, pick a mesh which does not have UV or color seams (ie, duplicated vertices with the same 
position but two or more texture coordinates or color values),
as this requires some additional vertex mapping to be performed when rendering the results of the cloth simulation.
