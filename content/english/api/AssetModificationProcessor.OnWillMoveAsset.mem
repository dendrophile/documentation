CSNONE
This is called by Unity when it is about to move an asset on disk.
If this is implemented, it allows you to move the asset yourself but do remember to return the correct enum or do some other processing and let Unity move the file
The moving of the asset can be prevented by returning AssetMoveResult.FailedMove
You should not call any Unity AssetDatabase api from within this callback, preferably keep to file operations or VCS apis.
