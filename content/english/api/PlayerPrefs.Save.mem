Writes all modified preferences to disk.
By default Unity writes preferences to disk on Application Quit.
In case when the game crashes or otherwise prematuraly exits,
you might want to write the PlayerPrefs at sensible 'checkpoints' in your game.
This function will write to disk potentially causing a small hiccup, therefore it is not recommended to call during actual gameplay.
