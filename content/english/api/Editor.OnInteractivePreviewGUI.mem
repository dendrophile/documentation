Implement to create your own interactive custom preview. Interactive custom previews are used in the preview area of the inspector and the object selector.
Implement this instead of ::ref::OnPreviewGUI if you only want to 
The overidden method should use the rectangle passed in and render a preview of the asset into it.
The default implementation is a no-op.

__Note:__ Inspector previews are limited to the primary editor of persistent objects (assets), e.g., GameObjectInspector, MaterialEditor, TextureInspector.
This means that it is currently not possible for a component to have its own inspector preview.
