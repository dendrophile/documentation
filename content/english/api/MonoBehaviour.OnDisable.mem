This function is called when the behaviour becomes disabled () or inactive.
This is also called when the object is destroyed and can be used for any cleanup code.
When scripts are reloaded after compilation has finished, OnDisable will be called, followed by an OnEnable after the script has been loaded.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	function OnDisable () {
		print("script was removed");
	}
END EX
OnDisable cannot be a co-routine.
