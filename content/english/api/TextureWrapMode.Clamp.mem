Clamps the texture to the last pixel at the border.
This is useful for preventing wrapping artifacts when mapping an image onto an object and you don't want the texture to tile.
UV coordinates will be clamped to the range 0...1. When UVs are larger than 1 or smaller than 0, the last pixel at the border will be used.
