The force that needs to be applied for this joint to break.
The force might come from collisions with other objects, forces applied with rigidbody.AddTorque or from other joints.
SA: [[Joint.OnJointBreak]]

	// Makes the joint break when a force larger than 10 is applied
	hingeJoint.breakForce = 10;
	// Makes the joint unbreakable
	hingeJoint.breakForce = Mathf.Infinity;
