AABB of this Animation animation component in local space.
By default it is computed based on animation states (i.e. attached animation clips), unless user overrides it by setting
value to localBounds. You can switch back to precomputed bounds by setting ::ref::cullingType to AnimationCullingType::ref::BasedOnClipBounds.
Value of localBounds is undefined when cullingType is not set to [[AnimationCullingType.BasedOnClipBounds]] or [[AnimationCullingType.BasedOnUserBounds]].
When setting localBounds cullingType will be set to [[AnimationCullingType.BasedOnUserBounds]] automatically.
SA: AnimationClip::ref::localBounds property, ::ref::cullingType, [[AnimationCullingType.BasedOnClipBounds]].
