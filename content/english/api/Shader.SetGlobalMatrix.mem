Sets a global matrix property for all shaders.

Global properties are used if a shader needs them but the material does
not have them defined (for example, if the shader does not expose them
in /Properties/ block).

SA: ::ref::SetGlobalColor, ::ref::SetGlobalFloat; [[Material]] class, [[wiki:Shaders|ShaderLab documentation]].
