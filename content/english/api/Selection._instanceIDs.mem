The actual unfiltered selection from the Scene returned as instance ids instead of ::ref::objects.
Only objects from the Scene or Hierarchy will be returned, not from the Project View. You can also assign objects to the selection.

The instance ID of an object is always guaranteed to be unique.

SA: Selection.objects, Object.GetInstanceID
