Returns this vector with a ::ref::magnitude of 1 (RO).

Note that the current vector is unchanged and a new normalized vector is returned. If you
want to normalize the current vector, use ::ref::Normalize function.

If the vector is too small to be normalized a zero vector will be returned.

SA: ::ref::Normalize function.
