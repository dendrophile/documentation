@param rotation Orientation of the handle
@param position Center of the handle in 3D space
@param angleAndRange Vector2 containing angle in .x and range in .y
@param angleScale Scale value for angle value (if you want the cone angle to be displayed scaled relative to the real angle)
@param rangeScale Scale value for range value (if you want the cone range to be displayed scaled relative to the real range)
@param handlesOnly Determines whether a cone will be drawn as well as the handles
