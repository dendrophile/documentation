Assign a list of icons for the specified platform.

Most platforms support viewing icons in multiple sizes so Unity lets you specify multiple icon textures for each platform.
The list will only be assigned if it has the same length as the list of icon sizes returned by GetIconSizesForTargetGroup
and if the specified platform is supported in this editor.
