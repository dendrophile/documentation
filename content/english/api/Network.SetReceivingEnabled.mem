Enable or disables the reception of messages in a specific group number from a specific player.
You can use the when you do not want any network messages coming in for processing at the moment, and then enable it later
when you are ready. This is useful to stop network messages until a level is loaded, for example.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	// Stop receiving messages in group 0 from all players (clients)
	for (var player : NetworkPlayer in Network.connections)
		Network.SetReceivingEnabled(player, 0, false);
END EX
