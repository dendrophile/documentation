The maximimum angular velocity of the rigidbody. (Default 7) range { 0, infinity }
The angular velocity of rigidbodies is clamped to maxAngularVelocity to avoid numerical instability with fast rotating bodies.
Because this may prevent intentional fast rotations on objects such as wheels, you can override this value per rigidbody.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	rigidbody.maxAngularVelocity = 10;
END EX
