Recursive-up search in Materials forlders.

Unity will perform a recursive-up search for the material in all Materials folders up to the Assets folder.
For example: if model is Assets/Model/MyModel.fbx, then it will try to locate the material in these folders in this order:
Assets/Model/Materials, Assets/Materials.
