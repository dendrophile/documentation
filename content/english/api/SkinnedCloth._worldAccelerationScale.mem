How much world-space acceleration of the character will affect cloth vertices.
The higher this value is, the more the cloth will move as a reaction to world space acceleration of the GameObject.
If the cloth appears lifeless, try increasing this value. If it appears to get unstable when the character accelerates, try decreasing the value.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	GetComponent(SkinnedCloth).worldAccelerationScale = 1.0;
END EX
