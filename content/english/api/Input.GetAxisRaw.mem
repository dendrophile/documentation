Returns the value of the virtual axis identified by /axisName/ with no smoothing filtering applied.
The value will be in the range -1...1 for keyboard and joystick input.
Since input is not smoothed, keyboard input will always be either -1, 0 or 1.
This is useful if you want to do all smoothing of keyboard input processing yourself.
