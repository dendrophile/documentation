The HingeJoint groups together 2 rigid bodies, constraining them to move like connected by a hinge.

This joint is great for, well, doors, but can also be used to model chains, etc...

The HingeJoint has a motor which can be used to make the hinge spin around the joints axis.
A spring which attempts to reach for a target angle by spinning around the joints axis.
And a limit which constrains the joint angle.
