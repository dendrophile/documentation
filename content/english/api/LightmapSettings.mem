Stores lightmaps of the scene.

A scene can have several lightmaps stored in it, and [[Renderer]] components can use those
lightmaps. This makes it possible to use the same material on multiple objects, while
each object can refer to a different lightmap or different portion of the same lightmap.

SA: [[LightmapData]] class, Renderer.lightmapIndex property.
