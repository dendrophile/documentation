The camera we are currently rendering with, for low-level render control only (Read Only).

Most of the time you will want to use Camera.main instead.
Use this function only when implementing one of the following events:
MonoBehaviour.OnRenderImage, MonoBehaviour.OnPreRender, MonoBehaviour.OnPostRender.
