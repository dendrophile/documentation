*undoc* --- we have normalized property now<signature>
Normalize_Vector4
Normalize
</signature>
Makes this vector have a ::ref::magnitude of 1.

Note that this function will change the current vector. If you
want to keep the current vector unchanged, use ::ref::normalized variable.

If this vector is too small to be normalized it will be set to zero.

SA: ::ref::normalized variable.
