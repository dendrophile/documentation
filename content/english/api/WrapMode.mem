Determines how time is treated outside of the keyframed range of an [[AnimationClip]] or [[AnimationCurve]].

The WrapMode that the animation system uses for a specific animation is determined this way:\\
You can set the WrapMode of an [[AnimationClip]] in the import settings of the clip. This is the recommended way to control the WrapMode.\\
When an [[AnimationState]] is created, it inherits its WrapMode from the [[AnimationClip]] it is created from, but you can also change it from code.\\
If the WrapMode of an [[AnimationState]] is set to Default, the animation system will use the WrapMode from the [[Animation]] component.\\
