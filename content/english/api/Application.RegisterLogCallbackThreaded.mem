Register a delegate to be called on log messages.
The only difference between this function and
RegisterLogCallback is that this function gets __called__ from a
different thread.

__Note:__ You should *only* use this function if you know what you
are doing, else just use Application.RegisterLogCallback.

SA: [[Application.LogCallback]], [[Application.RegisterLogCallback]], [[LogType]].
