Retrieve native ('hardware') handle to a texture.

Use this function to retrieve an ID/handle corresponding to a particular texture
as it is represented on the native graphics device level.
This can be used to enable texture manipulation from [[wiki:NativePluginInterface|native code plugins]].

This function is only supported on OpenGL-like devices; for a better cross-platform
approach use ::ref::GetNativeTexturePtr.
