Creates a game save
/displayName/ is the save file name shown on the dashboard.
/fileName/ is the save file name on disc. This name must be unique on every physical media.
/mountName/ is the name of the virtual drive the save file is mounted to. i.e. specifying "name" will create a drive accessible via "name:\". 
Call /Unmount/ with the same mount name once saving/loading is finished.
Returns false if a storage operation is already active by checking /IsStorageOpActive/ or if the selected user is not signed-in and /Ready/.
/onComplete/ is never called if this function returns false.
