The platform application is running. Returned by Application.platform.

__Note:__ The difference between using RuntimePlatform and Platform dependent Compilation
is that using RuntimePlatform is evaluated at runtime while Platform dependent Compilation is
evaluated at compile time. So if you can use platform dependent compilation, don't hesitate to use it. In most cases, you can
get the same functionality using both, and using the defines will produce smaller and faster code, as you don't need to check at runtime. 
There are some cases where RuntimePlatform is needed, for example: if you need to check which platform you are running a webplayer you may check this
at runtime.
