Continuous collision detection is on for colliding with static and dynamic geometry.
Prevent this Rigidbody from passing through static mesh geometry, and through other 
Rigidbodies which have continuous collision detection enabled, when it is moving fast.
This is the slowest collision detection mode, and should only be used for selected fast moving objects.
